# About the experiment

The core guiding principle behind this game, or the underlying 'vibe' I wish to
achieve, is one of being awed by nature in both positive and negative ways,
ideally, focusing on the natural elements of the Bavarian Alps circa 16th
century.

Since this particular experiment is about the style of the game, it can even
be done entirely within Blender.

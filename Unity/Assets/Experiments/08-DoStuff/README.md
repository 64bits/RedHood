# About the experiment

The do-stuff experiment is about nailing the vibe of running around the area
and actually being able to entertain yourself via harvesting and chasing an
animal etc. I would also like to play around with the concept of hurting one-
self, which for now ought to work by "scratching up" your inventory.

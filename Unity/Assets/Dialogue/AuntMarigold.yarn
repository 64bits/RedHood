Aunt Marigold: Oh, it's you! You're here to see your grandmother, right?
Aunt Marigold: I hate to be the one telling you this but she hasn't been around for a while.
Aunt Marigold: Where has she been? No idea.
Aunt Marigold: We looked for her at first, but now...
Aunt Marigold: Well, I'm sure she's alright. Just be careful out there.
Aunt Marigold: And be sure to get back indoors before nightfall!
Aunt Marigold: You're welcome to spend the night here, of course.
